        <p class="first">One of the beautiful things about genre fiction is how authors are able to bring mythical 
            creatures to life on the page — whether that’s a demonic being in a horror novel<br> 
            or a winged sidekick in a fantasy series. And while many of the creatures you see in the pages of 
            your favorite books are original creations, they’re very often inspired by<br> 
            (or an amalgam of various)<br> 
            creatures from myth.<br><br> </p>

          <p class="second">  In this post, we’re running through a list of mythical creatures 
            and giving you a couple of literary examples to help you begin your hunt for these wonderful, 
            fantastical beings.<br><br></p>

            <p class="Third">First up, let's look at the creatures who look human 
                (but most definitely are not).</p>
    


    
        
        
        

                <p> <a name="Boogeyman🤡"></a>
               
              <div id="boo">

              
            <h1> Boogeyman🤡</h1>
            
            <p>

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogeyman">
                <img src="../img/boog.jpg"></a>

                


                

            The bogeyman can take many forms, but their purpose remains constant: to scare 
            the living daylights out of children and coerce them into good behavior. A bogeyman might be 
            an actual human (in one of the tales of Struwwelpeter, a tailor cuts off a boy's thumbs because 
            he sucks them too much), but in most cases, it’s a supernatural force of some type.
            While the description of the Bogeyman differs on a cultural level, there are often some shared 
            similarities to the creatures. Many of the Bogeymen are depicted as having claws, talons, and 
            sharp teeth. Along with that, the majority of Bogeymen are of the spirit variety, while the 
            minority are demons, witches, and other legendary creatures. Some are even described to have 
            certain animal features such as horns, hooves, and bug like appearances.
            When looking at the personality traits of the Bogeymen, they are most easily divided into three 
            categories; the kind that punishes misbehaved children, the kind that are more prone to violence, 
            and the kind that protect the innocent. They all relate in the same way, being that they all 
            exist to teach young children lessons. The large majority of Bogeymen are there to just frighten 
            children with punishments, and not actually inflict much damage. The more vicious Bogeyman is 
            said to steal the children at night, and even eat them. The last category is the Bogeyman who 
            protects people and only punishes those guilty, regardless of age.<br><br>

            Though their portrayals will vary across culture — from brooding sexy ones in 
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Saga-Book-1/dp/0316015849"> Twilight</a> 
            and Anne Rice novels to terrifying monstrous Count Orlok in "Nosferatu" — there are a few things 
            that remain the same: vampires feed on the living to remain immortal, they avoid sunlight, and 
            their hearts are vulnerable to sharp objects — you know, just like you and me. Often a metaphor 
            for the dangers of sexual desire, vampires have remained firmly in the cultural consciousness for 
            over a hundred and fifty years.
            The notion of vampirism has existed for millennia. Cultures such as the Mesopotamians, Hebrews, 
            Ancient Greeks, Manipuri and Romans had tales of demons and spirits which are considered 
            precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampiric creatures in these ancient 
            civilizations, the folklore for the entity known today as the vampire originates almost 
            exclusively from early 18th-century southeastern Europe,
            when verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. 
            In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but 
            they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by 
            a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass 
            hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.<br><br>

            Jewish folklore has more than its fair share of creatures that will send chills 
            down your spine. 
            Perhaps none more than the dybbuk, the dislocated soul of someone deceased who has taken over a 
            host body to complete unfinished business. Though one was featured in
            <a href="https://youtu.be/aFpn3Cv2CE4"> The opening scene</a> of The  Coen Brothers' A Serious Man,
             Dybbuks have recently re-entered popular imagination as the
            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-45559534"> unlikely antagonist of rapper Post Malone.</a>
            There are other forms of soul transmigration in Jewish mythology. In contrast to the dybbuk, 
            the ibbur (meaning "impregnation") is a positive possession, which happens when a righteous 
            soul temporarily possesses a body. This is always done with consent, so that the soul can 
            perform a mitzvah.Isaac Luria (1534–72), a mystic, laid the grounds for Jewish belief in a 
            dybbuk with his doctrine of transmigration of souls (gilgul), which he saw as a means 
            whereby souls could continue their task of self-perfection.His disciples went one step 
            further with the notion of possession by a dybbuk.

            A female spirit whose haunting howls herald a coming death. Banshees are a part

            best known for their ubiquity in modern metaphor (“screams like a banshee”) and their tendency to

            The size of the banshee is another physical feature that differs between regional accounts. 
            Though some accounts of her standing unnaturally tall are recorded, the majority of tales that 
            describe her height state the banshee's stature as short, anywhere between one foot and four 
            feet. Her exceptional shortness often goes alongside the description of her as an old woman, 
            though it may also be intended to emphasize her state as a fairy creature.The Scottish novelist 
            Sir Walter Scott mentioned belief in a kind of banshee or household spirit in certain 
            Highland families (Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft, 1830).<br><br>

            An enduring motif in mythology across Europe, werewolves (or lycanthropes,
             to give them their SAT name) served a similar function to witches, as men were commonly
            hunted and executed in the 
            belief that they transformed into "ravenous creatures" called werewolves. In more recent times, 
            they have become the subject of classic horror films, and even the object of affection in 
            certain corners of paranormal romance."The werewolf" is a more widespread concept in European folklore, 
            existing in many variants, which are related by a common development of a Christian 
            interpretation of underlying European folklore developed during the medieval period. 
            From the early modern period, werewolf beliefs also spread to the New World with colonialism. 
            Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in witches, in the course of the 
            Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period. Like the witchcraft trials as a whole, the 
            trial of supposed werewolves emerged in what is now Switzerland (especially the Valais and Vaud) 
            in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th, peaking in the 17th and 
            subsiding by the 18th century.<br><br>

A demon is a malevolent supernatural entity. Historically, belief 
in demons, or stories about demons, 
occurs in religion, occultism, literature, fiction, mythology, and folklore; 
as well as in media such 
as comics, video games, movies, anime, and television series. 
Belief in demons probably goes back to the Paleolithic age, stemming from 
humanity's fear of the unknown,
the strange and the horrific.
In Ancient Near Eastern religions and in the Abrahamic religions, including 
early Judaism and 
ancient-medieval Christian demonology, a demon is considered a harmful 
spiritual entity which may 
cause demonic possession, calling for an exorcism. Large portions
of Jewish demonology, a key 
influence on Christianity and Islam, originated from a later
form of Zoroastrianism, 
and was transferred to Judaism during the Persian era.
Note that demons may or may not also be considered to be devils:
minions of The Devil.
In many traditions, demons are independent operators, with different demons causing 
different types of evils (destructive natural phenomena, specific diseases, etc.).
In religions featuring a principal Devil (e.g. Satan) locked in an eternal struggle 
with God, demons are often also thought to be subordinates of the principal Devil. 
As lesser spirits doing the Devil's work, they have additional duties— causing humans 
to have sinful thoughts and tempting humans to commit sinful actions.</p><hr>
